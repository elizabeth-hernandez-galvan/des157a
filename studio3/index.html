            <h1>Triwizard Tourney Instructions</h1>
            <p>There are two players. Player options include: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Players will randomly be sorted into a house. The Globlet of fire will choose the player. The player whose turn it is casts a spell. The total points from the spells are added to the current player's score, unless either spell score comes up as a "one". If this happens, this player's turn is over, and it is the other player’s turn. After each cast, the current player can either cast again, (assuming a score of "one" was not casted) or if the current player feels scared, they can hide and pass their turn to the other player. </p>

            <p>Oh, and if you cast spells with two scores of "ones" (wand malfunction), your current score gets zeroed out, and you have to go through all the tasks again. So don’t do that.</p>

            <p>In order to win, each player must overcome the three tasks.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dragon:</strong> At 10 points, the player will Slay the Dragon.</li>
                <li><strong>Hogwarts Lake:</strong> At 20 points, the player will Survive the Hogwarts Lake.</li>
                <li><strong>Labyrinth:</strong> At 30 points, the player will conquer the Labyrinth.</li>
            </ol>
                
            <p> The first player to get 30 points or higher, has successfully completed all three tasks and becomes a TRIWIZARD CHAMPION.</p>
