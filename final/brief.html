                        <p>For this project, I hope to focus on the story and incorporate more factors. I want to tailor the game to the Goblet of Fire game seen in Harry Potter. The player will be playing against the computer given that the main idea behind the tournament is to test each individual player and see if they have what it takes to become champion. I want to implement different tasks where the player has to overcome all of them in order to become a champion and win the trophy/game. The tasks that I will included will be the fight against the dragon, surviving the merpeople of Hogwarts Lake, and finding their way through the maze. </p>

                        <p>I want to keep a black and white aesthetic with the interactive colors in the background. I will limit the color to only the images of the players themselves. I want to see if I can change my circles to stars in order to more align with the wizarding world. I also want to highlight the player whose turn it is by making the square of the non player smaller and removing the white box shadow and then focusing on the player whose turn it is. I want to include multiple pages so that the user has a better overall experience and understands how to play the game.</p>

                        <p>I will include a carasel like interaction where each sreen offers different options. It will start with the instructions and then scroll through the challenges until reaching the end of the game.</p>

                        <p>My goal is for the user to be captivated by the story and want to keep playing. By playing against the computer they will have more feasability to play on their own time and try different times as there will always be a different outcome.</p>
