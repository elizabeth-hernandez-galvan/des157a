                <p>This image relates to collection as it is one of a series of pictures I have from my travels. This image is special as it indicates the start of my traveling journey. This collection recalls previous travel and how much of the globe there is still left for me to traverse.</p>

                    <img src="images/Reno.jpg" alt="Reno" style="width:100%">
                    <figcaption>Fig.1 - Reno, Nevada.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This image is interesting because we were surrounded by so many lights from all the surrounding buildings but this was the one sign that was not fully lit up. Only one of the letters was fully on, the others were either completely off or only parts of the letters turned on.  The snow within the image reminds me of my journey to Reno and driving through a snow storm with my family for the first time. On this family road trip, we were able to see the transformation of rain to snow as we crossed over to Nevada; Experiencing a 10 hour drive instead of five hours as we navigated the freeways at 15miles an hour. </p>

                <p>As designers we should embody the detective trait of of paying attention to detain without compromising the big detail. It's best to look at visuals with an open mind and make observations towards a conclusion without the limitations of finding the right answer. When looking through various examples like <a class ="web" href="url">Awwwards.com</a>, I really like the amount of interactivity within the pages.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite visual sites is "<a class ="web" href="https://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/">The Boat</a>" which recalls a girl's journey at sea. She is scared of all the unfamiliarity and everything that is going on around her. She struggles to distinguish dreams from reality. By scrolling through this site, you can see the visuals associated to the story and hear the background sounds as if you were a part of the story. There is not much background as to how the girl got on the boat so it's up to readers to pay attention to all the details and enjoy the visual story.</p>

                <p>An overlay is typically a small box displayed on top of a portion of a page. The apple example of bad overlay use is interesting as we don't really notice how common this technique really is. Many sites that are geared towards helping solve some issues have scrollable overlays trying to fit as much information as possible into a mall window. As a designer, I will provide a way to close the overlay as I have experienced this frustration as a user where I have to wait for a certain amount of time to be able to close it or spend some time looking for the button to close it as it's not easy to find.</p>

                <p>When considering the use of overlays, I will take into account my target audience, their intended task, the possibility of causing an interruption, where the window will be positioned, and understand my decision to make an overlay instead of a page. I want to be able to use overlays without creating confusion and limiting accessibility.</p>

                <p>As designers, we have to account for the amount of work users want to put into forms. For example, when filling out surveys, I look to see how long it is before deciding if I am to complete it at the moment or come back to it later. I agree with the "less is more" theory. Simplifying the form whether that's putting everything within one column or categorizing sections will help users have a faster completion time. I don't like filling out forms that feel endless. Some don't include any progress bar or indication of the survey coming to an end which diminishes my experience.</p>

                <p>Additionally, it helps to differentiate any requirements whether that's special formatting or marking required fields. Previously, I would use placeholder text but now I realize this isn't the best way to provide hints as the text disappears once the user starts typing something.</p>
